#Gameplay mechanic

Neontilt was inspired by "ball maze" games and "Arkanoid", the player is a ball that must destroy every block on a floor while avoiding falling into holes, the player needed to have good control of the ball.

##Ball Movement

At first I thought that the ball would move by virtue of the plataform tilting, same as with ball maze games, but it was too slow, so I added a small amount of force to the tilting direction in such a way that it seems like its the tilt alone that moves the ball.

# Welcome to Neontilt's code

In the "Game" folder you will find a folder with the code I wrote and/or worked on and another with the rest of the scripts.

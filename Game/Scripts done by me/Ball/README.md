#Gameplay mechanic
Neontilt was inspired by "ball maze" games and "Arkanoid", the player is a ball that must destroy every block on a floor while avoiding falling into holes, the player needed to have good control of the ball.

##Ball Movement
At first I thought that the ball would move by virtue of the plataform tilting, same as with ball maze games, but it was too slow, so I added a small amount of force to the tilting direction in such a way that it seems like its the tilt alone that moves the ball.
